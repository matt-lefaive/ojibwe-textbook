            <h2 id='full-verb-charts'>Full verb charts</h2>
            <p>
                We are now going to begin introducing full verb charts for memorization using SRS. As a gentle introduction, we will start with VII verbs since their charts are the smallest, and we also haven’t been paying much attention to VII verbs so far in this course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned previously, VII verbs often correspond to adjectives in English, but not always. A full verb chart for a VII verb only has four entries. We are going to use three different VII verbs in our charts, as they illustrate slightly different forms of the endings depending on what the final sounds of the stem are. First, the verb <strong>michaa</strong> – it is big. For the different subjects, we will use the conventional abbreviations
            </p>
            <p>
                0 = inanimate singular
                <br/>0’ = inanimate singular obviative
                <br/>0p = inanimate plural
                <br/>0p’ = inanimate plural obviative
            </p>
            <table className='full-border'>
                <tr>
                    <th>subject</th>
                    <th>verb</th>
                    <th>translation</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>0p</td>
                    <td>michaawan</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0p’</td>
                    <td>michaaniwan</td>
                    <td>They are big for h/.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                That is a whole chart. You may ask, what about the negative forms, the conjunct forms? Those are separate charts. We don’t generally put all those forms on one chart. So generally speaking, there will be four charts in total for this course for every VII verb. The forms shown above are “Independent Positive.” You will also have “Independent Negative, Conjunct Positive, and Conjunct Negative.” Yes, Conjunct can be plain or changed, but as long as you memorize the individual initial vowel changes, you won’t have to re-memorize the whole Conjunct chart to go from plain to changed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Just to let you know what lies in the more distant future in your journey through Ojibwe verb conjugation, the one other “order” besides Independent and Conjunct is Imperative, or commands. There will be three kinds of imperatives, which means three more charts – Imperative Positive (do it now!), Imperative Negative (don’t do it!), and Imperative Delayed (do it later!). There is no delayed negative imperative. However, for VII verbs there are no imperatives – we don’t usually give commands to inanimate objects. If you did want to give a command to an inanimate object (like “disappear!” because you are a stage magician), there are ways, but that’s an advanced topic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So that makes seven charts per verb (but only 4 for VII) in this course. Beyond that there are the preterite and dubitative forms, which we won’t cover until much later. You can get pretty far without them, and you will eventually pick up on them anyway if you continue with your Ojibwe learning. This may sound like a lot, and it may sound intimidating, but that is pretty much all there is to learn even in the long run. With regular practice you will master it all. 
            </p>

            <h2 id='the-obviative-for-vii'>The obviative for VII</h2>
            <p>
                In previous lessons, we discussed the use of obviative verb forms for when there are two (or more) different “third person” people discussed in a conversation. One person is “foregrounded” and gets the usual 3rd-person “proximative” form, and the less prominent person gets the obviative form. It turns out that there are also obviative forms used with inanimate objects for VII verbs. Generally these are used when the object specifically relates to a third person (animate) involved in the conversation. It is not easy to explain exactly and concisely when the obviative VII form is used, and there is a lot of variability among dialects and speakers, and even inconsistent use within the same speaker. It is not our goal here to give you a complete understanding of when to use this form - you will have to get that through practice and exposure to fluent speakers and texts. We just want to teach you here how to recognize the form and produce it. By including the VII obviative form now, we are able to give you complete VII verb charts that you can memorize. When we ask speakers about the VII obviative forms, the example that they most often give involves clothing fitting on a person, so that is what we have used in the dialog. 
            </p>

            <h2 id='obviative-plural-for-inanimates'>Obviative plural for inanimates</h2>
            <p>
                While there is no distinction (at least in the dialect we’re teaching) between singular and plural obviatives for animate verbs, there is such a distinction for VII verbs. This comes up in today’s dialog as the characters are discussing this shirt vs. that shirt for h/. The first shirt takes the proximate form and the second one takes the obviative form. Then ending <strong>-ni</strong> shows up in a lot of obviative verb forms. You won’t confuse it with the <strong>ni-</strong> for first-person, as that is a prefix, whereas the obviative marker <strong>-ni</strong> shows up in the ending of the verb. We also have the ending <strong>-wan</strong> marking the inanimate plural. This is easy to remember as <strong>-wan</strong> resembles the inanimate noun plural marker <strong>-an</strong>. We caution you though, that <strong>-wan</strong> can function as a plural marker for inanimate verbs, but it can also be an obviative marker for animate verbs. You will memorize each verb form individually, but this is an important distinction to keep in mind to avoid getting confused. And it helps to remember that for animate plurals (nouns or verbs), the plural endings often involve <strong>-g</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The conjunct and conjunct participle suffix for vii obviative is -nig, and that is for both singular and plural, like our example in the dialogue, conjunct: <strong>minwaabaminaagwadinig</strong>, when/if/that it/they looks good (for h/ or them).
            </p>

            <h2 id='vii-verbs-tied-to-object-properties'>VII verbs tied to object properties</h2>
            <p>
                We use the verb <strong>miskwegad</strong> in this dialog. This means “it (sheet-like) is red.” By “sheet-like” we mean that this verb form applies to things made out of paper, fabric, etc. For other kinds of objects there are different verbs, often related in form. The more basic word for “it is red” is <strong>miskwaa</strong>. But since we are talking about shirts here, we go with the more appropriate <strong>miskwegad</strong>. Similar words exist for the other colours in this lesson. 
            </p>
            <table className='full-border'>
                <tr>
                    <th>English</th>

                    <td>miskwaa</td>
                    <td>miskwegad</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>blue/green</td>
                    <td>ozhaawashkwaa</td>
                    <td>ozhaawashkwegad</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>yellow/brown</td>
                    <td>ozaawaa</td>
                    <td>ozaawegad</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                As you can see, the “sheet-like” verbs are fairly predictable in form from the general colour verbs. We do recommend memorizing the words individually, but these regularities make it easier. Besides “sheet-like,” there are a few other object properties that call for specific kinds of VII verbs in Ojibwe. You will learn more as we go. If you used the general verb <strong>miskwaa</strong> to describe a shirt, people would understand you, but you would sound a little funny. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also used the term <strong>agaasiigad</strong> to describe a shirt (sheet-like) as small. This contrasts with the word <strong>agaasin</strong> which is used more generally to mean small. This would be used for shoes, which are ordinary objects without any special shape properties calling for a special verb. In the dialog, we see the “sheet-like” verb <strong>michiigad</strong> for a shirt being big, and the more general verb <strong>michaa</strong> for a shoe being big. 
            </p>
            
            <h2 id='participles'>Participles</h2>
            <p>
                We have started to introduce some participles in this dialog. A participle is essentially a verb form that functions as a noun. Let’s start with the verb <strong>miskwegad</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, if we want to say “the red shirt,” since we don’t really have adjectives in Ojibwe, we need to use a verb – we are basically saying something like “the shirt that is red,” or more poetically, something like “the redding shirt.” This is a participle, just like “running” is an English participle when you use it like “the running man” or “my running shoes.” Participles are extremely common in Ojibwe, so even though they are considered as a bit of an advanced topic, we are introducing them now. They do vary considerably by dialect, which makes things tricky for teaching. But for now, for the forms we are teaching here, participles are 100% identical to changed conjunct, and they are an important example of how the changed conjunct forms come up in conversation. So to form an Ojibwe participle, first we form the conjunct form – independent <strong>miskwegad</strong> becomes plain conjunct <strong>miskwegak</strong>. We will learn to make the Conjunct forms later (sorry, more charts), but you should recognize this ending because we previously taught you <strong>dibikad</strong> – it is dark, and plain conjunct <strong>dibikak</strong> – when it is dark. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, since this should be a changed conjunct form, we also need the initial vowel change. <strong>Miskwegak</strong> transforms further to <strong>meskwegak</strong>. You can use this to modify a noun, as in <strong>i’iw meskwegak babagiwayaan</strong> “that red shirt,” or on its own <strong>i’iw meskwegak</strong> “that red one.” Again, this form is both a Changed Conjunct and a Participle. You can mostly think of those two concepts as identical until we tell you otherwise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our dialog also contains the sentence: <strong>Mii onow geget wenizhishingin</strong>. 
                <br/>As we mentioned in the last lesson, any sentence starting with <strong>mii</strong> is going to involve a Conjunct form. <strong>Geget</strong> is a straightforward adverb meaning “really, truly, very much so.” Then we have <strong>wenizhishingin</strong>. You should spot the beginning <strong>we-</strong> as the result of an initial change – this is a form of the VII verb <strong>onizhishin</strong>, which we have seen before. With that initial change, it looks like a changed conjunct. In the dialect we are teaching, the changed Conjunct form of this verb would be <strong>wenizhishin</strong>. The additional ending <strong>-gin</strong> making <strong>wenizhishingin</strong> indicates that this form is a participle. The phrase literally means something like “These are the ones that are (actually) nice,” or “These are the nice ones.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Participles are a fairly advanced topic that differ significantly by dialect, so we are not going to teach them in detail in the introductory levels of the course, but we also don’t want you to be confused when you see them. Many participles that are plural end in <strong>-gin</strong> or <strong>-jin</strong>, whereas the singular forms are identical to Changed Conjunct forms. So if you come across a verb form ending in <strong>-gin</strong> or <strong>-jin</strong> in a text, it is probably a participle, and knowing that fact will at least help you figure out what the citation form of the verb is so you can look it up in a dictionary.
            </p>

            <h2 id='changed-conjunct-in-question'>Changed Conjunct in question</h2>
            <p>
                There is one more example of a Changed Conjunct form in the dialog, <strong>Wegonen nendawendaman?</strong> What do you need? 
                <br/>As we mentioned, Changed Conjuncts are commonly used in questions involving who and what. The citation form for “to need” is <strong>nandawendan</strong> - “need it.” (Recall that the citation form for VTI is actually an imperative form). Further forms: 
                <br/><strong>ginandawendaan</strong> - you need it (Independent Neutral Positive). But this is a question, and it needs a Changed Conjunct form, not Independent. 
                <br/><strong>nandawendaman</strong> - if/when/that you need it (Conjunct Neutral Positive). This is the Plain Conjunct form. We haven’t taught you a chart yet for these, but you may recall seeing the ending <strong>-an</strong> for a second person form in a previous lesson, such as the word <strong>endaayan</strong> - at your place. To get the Changed Conjunct, we need to apply the initial change rule, <strong>a → e</strong>. Giving us <strong>nendawendaman</strong>.
