            <h2 id='vai-verbs'>VAI verbs</h2>  
            <p>
                Ojibwe is a language of verbs. Most of the information in a sentence is carried by verbs, and verbs also tend to carry out functions that are covered by other parts of speech in other languages. For example, Nimbakade – I am hungry. This is a verb. Ojibwe doesn’t really have adjectives. To express that someone or something is in a given state or has a certain property, you almost always use a verb. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional analysis of the grammar of Ojibwe (and related languages) suggests that there are four major categories of verbs in the language. Each category has its own set of prefixes and suffixes. It adds up to a lot to memorize, but don’t worry, we will take you through it step by step, one lesson at a time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To understand the four categories, it helps to know that Ojibwe nouns come in two kinds, or “genders.” These genders are not male and female as you might be familiar with in certain European languages, but rather animate and inanimate. Animate generally refers to living things and people, while inanimate refers to non-living objects. However, there are many exceptions. For example, in many dialects, the word for rock is animate. Some speakers of the language attribute spiritual significance to this, and some don’t. In this course, we won’t get too much into the philosophy, but we will teach this simply as a property of the language. It is similar to how in Spanish “table” is feminine but “book” is masculine. As you learn Ojibwe nouns, you will have to memorize whether they are animate or inanimate. As you’ll see, this distinction also affects what verbs you can use with different nouns. We’ll talk much more about this in time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this first lesson, we have not yet discussed anything inanimate – it is all just two people talking about their hunger and their plans to eat. Note that we are talking about them eating in general – “I want to eat,” not “I want to eat rice.” Rice would be an inanimate noun, and then we would have to start talking about verbs that interact with inanimate nouns, and we’re not there yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first category of verbs that we will cover are called “VAI” for “Verb, Animate Intransitive.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                The word animate implies that this verb takes a subject who is an animate noun, typically but not always a person. Next, intransitive means that the verb has a subject but no object. Intransitive verbs in English only involve a subject: I eat, you sleep, he is running. Some verbs in English can be both transitive and intransitive - for example “run” is intransitive in “I run,” but if you say “I want to run a marathon,” then “run” is transitive; it has “marathon” as an object. In Ojibwe, there are often similarities between transitive and intransitive verbs with similar meanings, but they are distinct words that need to be memorized separately. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ojibwe verbs are usually listed in a dictionary (the “citation form”) as a form with a bare minimum of prefixes or suffixes. For VAI verbs, an example would be bakade. By itself, this is a third-person singular form meaning “he or she is hungry.” We usually write “s/he” as an abbreviation for “she/he” so we would write “s/he is hungry” as the English definition for this word. This is also the form that you will find in most modern dictionaries. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We will get to plural forms later in the course, but for now we will teach the forms for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person singular (sg). These are associated with personal pronouns in Ojibwe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of vai verbs used in this lesson are: 
                <br/>bakade - “s/he is hungry,” 
                <br/>wiisini - “s/he is eating,” 
                <br/>giiwe - “s/he is going home,” 
                <br/>daa - “s/he is living in a certain place,” 
                <br/>giishkaabaagwe - “s/he is thirsty,” 
                <br/>minikwe - “s/he drinks,” 
                <br/>debisinii - “s/he is full from eating,” 
                <br/>mazinaatesijige - “s/he is watching a movie/tv.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Minikwe is labelled a vai+o, verb animate intransitive + object, which means it can be just a vai or it can relate to an object, like this example, doodooshaaboo niminikwen - “I am drinking milk,” In the majority of cases, you need to use an entirely different kind of verb (VTI) to talk about a person interacting with an object, but there are a few of these vai+o verbs that use a simple VAI form with an object, much like our English example of “run” and “run a marathon.” These are indicated as vai+o in the Ojibwe People’s Dictionary and some other dictionaries.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal pronouns: 
                <br/>niin - I, me
                <br/>giin – you (sg.) 
                <br/>wiin – s/he 
            </p>
            <p>
                These pronouns are fairly equivalent to their English translations, but they actually aren’t used that much in Ojibwe in ordinary conversation. This is because verbs take prefixes to indicate 1st 2nd and 3rd person, so you don’t need to add a pronoun on top of that. Here are the verb forms with prefixes: 
            </p>

            <table className='full-border text-center'>
                <tr>
                    <th>bare pronoun</th>
                    <th>verb prefix</th>
                    <th>full verb</th>
                    <th>translation</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>niin</td>
                    <td>nim-</td>
                    <td>nimbakade</td>
                    <td>I am hungry.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>giin</td>
                    <td>gi-</td>
                    <td>gibakade</td>
                    <td>You are hungry.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>wiin</td>
                    <td>-----</td>
                    <td>bakade</td>
                    <td>S/he is hungry.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                The prefix meaning “I” here is nim-, although the exact form of this prefix depends on the letters that follow it, for ease in pronunciation. You will also see it frequently as ni-. For “you,” we have the prefix gi-. This also comes in a few different forms. The exact pronunciation of these prefixes is subject to much variation - we will teach you one way and try to be consistent in our lessons, but you will encounter slightly different forms from town to town and from person to person (or even within one speaker). For the first person prefix, if you always pronounce it as ni-, you will be understood fine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are two more examples. The dictionary forms for these verbs are maajaa and nibaa. Note that these are also the third-person singular forms (this only applies to VAI verbs – the other verb classes have their own dictionary forms, again the most minimal forms with no prefixes or suffixes). 
            </p>

                </tr>

            </table>

            <p>
                A note about the English translations: In this course, for simplicity we will consistently use the simple past tense (I sleep, I leave), but usually a more accurate translation is the present progressive (I am sleeping, I am leaving), meaning an action that is currently in progress rather than something repeated or habitual. Ojibwe does not generally distinguish between these two types of present tense (although it definitely distinguishes lots of things that English speakers don’t, as you’ll learn). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, the third-person singular form shown here is the citation form that you will find in a dictionary. We emphasize this point a lot because learning Ojibwe is much easier when you know how to figure out the citation form from a verb that you come across, so you can look it up in a dictionary. So if you came across ginibaa, and you didn’t know what it meant, you might be able to guess that it’s the second person prefix gi- attached to the verb stem nibaa, which would be the citation form, and then you could look up nibaa in the dictionary. If a dictionary listed every single form of each verb, it would be a million pages long.
